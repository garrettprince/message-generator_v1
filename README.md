## General Information
This project demostrates some of the basics of my studies in Javascript including, but not limited to, arrays, functions, and string interpolation with template literals

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js

## Features
By calling the function getRandomSentence(), the user can create a semi-random sentence using the given arrays of nouns, adjectives, and verbs I provide.

## Setup
Install Node.js to run locally on your device.

## Project Status
- **_Complete_**


## Room for Improvement
The function is very basic. What I would like to see in a future iteration of this is a much larger pool of words to pull from, possible from a dictionary API so as to make it more 'random'.
